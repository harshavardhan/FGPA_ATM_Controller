CALLING FPGALINK FROM EXCEL/VBA

This example sheet connects to the device at 1443:0005 (hopefully a 1200K
Digilent Nexys2), loads the onboard FX2 chip with a new firmware, loads the
cksum example design into the board's FPGA, and then does some register reads
and writes. The changes to the board are lost on the next power cycle, so it's
safe to try.

You may need to install the Visual C++ 2010 redistributable package:

You will need to install proper drivers for your board, which you can get here:

The C functions in the FPGALink DLL are wrapped in VBA functions in the FPGALink
module. Note that the VBA code assumes it's running in a 32-bit (x86) edition of
Excel. If you want a 64-bit (x64) version, ask on the fpgalink-users mailing
list.

For Atlys and Nexys3, uncheck "Power on PD7" and enter "1443:0007" instead of
"1443:0005" for "Initial VID/PID", and choose an appropriate SVF, XSVF or CSVF
file for your board.
