CALLING FPGALINK FROM "C"

The examples below assume your device is a 1200K Digilent Nexys2. For other
boards, remove the "-d" option, replace "1443:0005" with whatever your board
enumerates as and choose an appropriate CSVF file.

  Usage: lin.x64/rel/c [-h] [-i <VID:PID>] -v <VID:PID> [-d <portConfig>]
            [-q <jtagPort>] [-p <progConfig>] [-f <dataFile>]

  Load FX2LP firmware, load the FPGA, interact with the FPGA.

    -i <VID:PID>    initial vendor and product ID of the FPGALink device
    -v <VID:PID>    renumerated vendor and product ID of the FPGALink device
    -d <portConfig> configure the ports
    -q <jtagPort>   scan the JTAG chain
    -p <progConfig> configuration and programming file
    -f <dataFile>   binary data to write to channel 0
    -h              print this help and exit

In order to build the example code, you'll need to install the MakeStuff build
infrastructure from http://bit.ly/makestuff and build FPGALink from source
(don't worry, it's straightforward). Then you'll be able to build and run the
example code like this:

  make
  dd of=/var/tmp/foo.dat if=/dev/urandom bs=65536 count=16
  lin.x64/rel/c -i 1443:0005 -v 1d50:602b:0002 -d D7+ -q D0D2D3D4 \
    -p J:D0D2D3D4:../../../../hdlmake/apps/makestuff/swled/cksum/vhdl/fpga.xsvf \
    -f /var/tmp/foo.dat

This connects to the device at 1443:0005 (hopefully a 1200K Digilent Nexys2),
loads the onboard FX2LP chip with a new firmware, loads the cksum example design
into the board's FPGA, and then does some channel reads and writes. The changes
to the board are lost on the next power cycle, so it's safe to try.
